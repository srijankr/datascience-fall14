CDC: Second Dallas Ebola patient took commercial flight

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering adding the
names of healthcare workers being monitored for the Ebola virus to the
government's no-fly list, federal officials tell Fox News. 

The move is being considered as a response to Wednesday's disclosure
that Dallas nurse Amber Joy Vinson was cleared to fly on a commercial
airliner earlier this week despite having been exposed to the Ebola
virus while treating Thomas Edward Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian
Hospital.

Texas health officials announced early Wednesday that Vinson, 29, had
tested positive for the virus, making her the second hospital worker to
become infected. Vinson's fellow nurse, 26-year-old Nina Pham, tested
positive last weekend. Over 70 workers involved in Duncan's treatment
are being monitored by the CDC. Duncan died Oct. 8 of the virus after
nearly two weeks in the hospital. 

On Monday, a CDC official cleared Vinson to fly from Cleveland to Dallas
on board Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 despite the fact that she had
called and reported having a slight fever, one of the common symptoms of
the Ebola virus. Vinson's reported temperature -- 99.5 degrees -- was
below the threshold of 100.4 degrees set by the agency and she had no
symptoms, according to CDC spokesman David Daigle.

On Wednesday, after Vinson was diagnosed with Ebola, CDC Director Dr.
Thomas Frieden acknowledged that the nurse should not have been allowed
to board the plane. Vinson had been in Ohio visiting family and had not
experienced initial symptoms during her outward journey. 

From now on, Frieden said, no one else involved in Duncan's care would
be allowed to travel "other than in a controlled environment." He cited
guidelines that permit charter flights or travel by car but no public
transportation.

Federal health officials are now attempting to track down Vinson's
fellow passengers on the flight, the CDC said Wednesday.  Frontier has
taken the aircraft out of service. The plane was flown Wednesday without
passengers from Cleveland to Denver, where the airline said it will
undergo a fourth cleaning, including replacement of seat covers,
carpeting and air filters. One Central Texas school district temporarily
closed three of its campuses because two of its students traveled on the
same flight as Vinson.

Early Thursday, Frontier released a statement saying that the crew of
Flight 1143 had been placed on paid leave for 21 days, despite CDC
guidance that they were all safe to fly.  On its website, the CDC says
all people possibly exposed to Ebola should restrict their travels --
including by avoiding commercial flights -- for 21 days. 

Also Thursday, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said it was offering
rooms to any workers being monitored for the virus who wished to avoid
the possibility of passing the virus to family or friends. 

Meanwhile, federal health officials, including Frieden, were scheduled
to testify before the oversight subcommittee of the House Emergy and
Commerce Committee Thursday. 

In prepared testimony, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health,
said Duncan's death and the infections of the two Dallas nurses and a
nurse in Spain "intensify our concerns about this global health threat."
He said two Ebola vaccine candidates were undergoing a first phase of
human clinical testing this fall. But he cautioned that scientists were
still in the early stages of understanding how Ebola infection can be
treated and prevented.

Medical records provided to The Associated Press by Duncan's family
showed Vinson inserted catheters, drew blood and dealt with Duncan's
body fluids. Late Wednesday, she arrived in Atlanta to be treated at
Emory University Hospital, which has already treated three Americans
diagnosed with the virus.

Also Wednesday, President Obama sought to ease fears in the U.S., urging
a stepped-up response even as he stressed that the danger in the United
States remained a long shot.

"We want a rapid response team, a SWAT team essentially, from the CDC to
be on the ground as quickly as possible, hopefully within 24 hours, so
that they are taking the local hospital step by step though what needs
to be done," he said.

But Obama also noted that the Ebola is not an airborne virus like the
flu and thus is more difficult to transmit.

The president made a point of noting that when he visited with health
care workers who had attended to Ebola patients at Emory University
Hospital in Atlanta, where Vinson was taken for further treatment late
Wednesday, he hugged and kissed them without fear of infection.

"They followed the protocols, they knew what they were doing," he said.
"I felt perfectly safe doing so."
